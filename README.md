# Fast API Implementation
Basic FastAPI implementation from Pluralsight. In this implementation you will find:

- Serving data with Fastapi
- Serving structured data using pydantic models
- Databases and Fastapi
- HTTP with Fastapi
- Authentication: HTTP basic authentication and OAuth2
- Testing
- Docker Deployment (This was not covered in the course)

This repo is based on the work done by Reindert-Jan Ekker on [FastAPI Fundamentals course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fastapi-fundamentals) from Pluralsight.

You can find the original implementation in here: [codesensei-courses/fastapi_fundamentals](https://github.com/codesensei-courses/fastapi_fundamentals)
